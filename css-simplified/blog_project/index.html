                <h2>Doom 3 Prologue</h2>
                <div>February 24th, 2140</div>
                <p>The prologue to *Doom 3* sets the stage for the game's terrifying narrative. Set in the year 2145,
                    the Union Aerospace Corporation (UAC) has established a research facility on Mars. There, they
                    uncover an ancient alien artifact, which unbeknownst to them, opens a portal to Hell itself. Demonic
                    forces begin to spill out, wreaking havoc on the facility, and the player takes on the role of a
                    space marine sent to investigate the mysterious and deadly occurrences.</p>
                <p>As the protagonist, you explore the decaying UAC facility, facing horrors from beyond as the world
                    around you collapses into chaos. The haunting atmosphere, paired with a series of unsettling events,
                    reveals that the company's greed and thirst for power have led to a catastrophic downfall. Now, it's
                    up to you to survive and put an end to the invasion before it spreads to Earth. To learn more about

                <h2>John Carmack's Role in Doom 3</h2>
                <div>February 24th, 2025</div>
                <div>By [Author Name]</div>
                <p>John Carmack, one of the co-founders of id Software, played a pivotal role in the development of
                    *Doom 3*. As the lead programmer, Carmack was responsible for pushing the technical boundaries of
                    gaming at the time. He was particularly known for his work on the game's advanced graphics engine,
                    which utilized real-time lighting and shadow techniques that were groundbreaking for the era.
                    Carmack's innovations helped define the game's eerie atmosphere and set new standards for visual
                    realism in first-person shooters. To learn more about his contributions, visit <a
